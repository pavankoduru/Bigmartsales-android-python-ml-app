# Bigmart Sales Prediction
## Introduction
Here we predict the sales of the store for particular item in that store  and in process of finding the sales we make use of machine learning algorithms. There are many types of machine learning algorithms
## Algorithms
We will work with the algorithms and choose the algorithm that gives best accuracy. That we build a model by the help of algorithm that take's input and gives the output.
### The Algorithms we build is
 Random Forest Classifier algorithm
#### Working of Algorithm
When working with algorithms we come up with two terms called train and test.
1. we have two datasets called train and test(csv files) and merge both of them and and preprocess the data and again divide those train and test and store them differently in different files(train_modified & test_modified).
1. Here After we build a model of Random Forest Algorithm
1. Firstly algorithm will  get's trained with the data, and the data used for trained is called as **train data**.
1. Step-3:The data that  left that which was not chosen as train data is called **test data**.
  1. Now the test data will be given to  the model to determine the accuracy of the data, the test data will not contain the target attribute which the   model returns that as output.
## Pickle
 Pickle in Python is primarily used in serializing and de-serializing a Python object structure. In other words, it's the process of converting a Python object into a byte stream to store it in a file/database, maintain program state across sessions, or transport data over the network.
